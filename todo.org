* Do initial class paperwork
** TODO Decide team name
** TODO Do we need a leader?
** TODO Formally create team by emailing TA
If you are still forming a team, please introduce your team by sending an email to Jake
j.zhao@nyu.edu with the following subject line and specify the team name, team members,
and their NetIDs.
[DS-GA-1008 YOUR_TEAM_NAME]

** TODO Who is our "corresponding TA"?


* DONE prepare programming environment
** DONE install lua and torch
** DONE create git repo
** DONE move this file to the git repo
** DONE install itorch notebook
https://github.com/facebook/iTorch#installing-itorch
** DONE set up cims environment
I already have an account, figure out how to log in.
if you can't use: 
https://www.cims.nyu.edu/webapps/content/systems/userservices/accounts/obtain
** DONE Set up CIMS web server for model submission
http://cims.nyu.edu/webapps/content/systems/userservices/webhosting


* TODO Week 1 Studying
** DONE Review slides from Lecture, make questions
** TODO Watch video / read slides from ICML tutorial

** TODO read lab notebook on tensors in torch
https://github.com/mayanks43/NYU-DL-2016/blob/master/Tensors.ipynb


* TODO Week 2 Studying
** TODO Read book about backprop
http://neuralnetworksanddeeplearning.com/chap2.html
** TODO read the convnet paper
http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/publis/pdf/lecun-98.pdf 
** TODO Go over lecture 2 slides
   

* DONE homework 1
http://cilvr.nyu.edu/lib/exe/fetch.php?media=deeplearning:2016:a1.pdf
** DONE Find solutions for problem 1
*** DONE Solve problem 1.1
*** DONE Solve problem 1.2
*** CANCELLED Solve problem 1.3
** DONE Write up solutions for problem 1
Use itorch notebook
** DONE Go through itorch notebook tutorial
http://code.madbits.com/wiki/doku.php?id=tutorial_supervised
*** DONE 1. Data prep
**** TODO What is the difference between the colon and dot operators?
**** TODO what is the hastag/pound operator?
**** TODO I don't understand the following syntax:
trainData.data[{ {},i,{},{} }]
trainData.data[{ i,{1},{},{} }]
**** TODO image.gaussian1D(7) ?
**** TODO I don't understand this normalization technique
*** DONE 2. Model prep
**** TODO What does "nn.Reshape(ninputs)" mean?
**** TODO nn.Linear(ninputs, noutputs)?
**** TODO nn.tables.random(nfeats, nstates[1], fanin[1])?
**** TODO Understand this conceptually
*** 3. Loss function
Nothing todo here
*** DONE 4. Training
**** TODO Don't understand the usage of the 'or' keyword
epoch = epoch or 1
**** TODO What does the 'local' keyword do?
local time = sys.clock()
**** TODO What does the ~= operator do?
if x ~= parameters then
**** TODO Understand this conceptually
*** 5. Testing
nothing new to do
** DONE Read and understand MNIST sample code
https://github.com/yjxiao/ds-ga-1008-a1
** DONE Run MNIST code on CIMSa
running locally instead

you@crunchy1[Documents]$ git clone https://github.com/yjxiao/ds-ga-1008-a1
you@crunchy1[Documents]$ module load torch
you@crunchy1[Documents]$ cd ds-ga-1008-a1
you@crunchy1[ds-ga-1008-a1]$ th doall.lua

works, but slowly, trying on cims to see if it's faster

actually, it's slower on cims!


** DONE Why don't the results from result.lua match those from doall?
** DONE improve performance of given model
*** DONE Add validation as suggested in the testing part of the tutorial
*** DONE Get the model to stop training once it 'converges'

*** DONE create script result.lua that generates predictions.csv
*** DONE convert and save the pictures
*** DONE add graphs to notebook
*** DONE save your changes to git
*** DONE Try the different model, loss function, and training ideas from the tutorial
** DONE do a full run of the simple model on the validation set so we have something to turn in
** DONE compare predictions.csv to someone else
** DONE write report on your model structure, training process, experiments, results, etc.
We expect a rather formal report written with Latex
use itorch notebook
** DONE Expose trained model file via CIMS
http://cims.nyu.edu/webapps/content/systems/userservices/webhosting f
** DONE Submit predictions.csv to Kaggle
** DONE Email final submission to TA
predictions.csv + result.lua + writeup

Send your submission (writeup and result.lua) to your corresponding TA by the deadline.
Merge your solutions to section 1 with the writeup from section 2. Include a link to the
trained model file in the email. Please use the following title for your email.
[DS-GA-1008 YOUR_TEAM_NAME] Submission A1
