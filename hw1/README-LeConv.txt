Maya Rotmensch (mer567) and Alex Pine (akp258)

1) Our writeup can be found at 'http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/pinesol/deeplearning/blob/master/hw1/Homework%201.ipynb'
2) Download our model file from http://cims.nyu.edu/~mer567/convnet_long_best.net into this directory (HW1)
3) To run our model, go to this directory in a shell, and run the following command:
th result.lua 
If you downloaded the model file to somewhere other than i the current directory then enter as argument '-model_filename' flag , followed by the path to the model.
4) Examine the predictions.csv file that command generates. It matches what we submitted on kaggle.
