Deep Learning 2016: Homework 1
Maya Rotmensch (mer567) and Alex Pine (akp258)

1) Our writeup can be found at 'http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/pinesol/deeplearning/blob/master/hw1/Homework%201.ipynb'
2) Download our model file from http://cims.nyu.edu/~mer567/homework1_model.net
3) To run our model, go to this directory in a shell, and run the following command:
`th result.lua -model_filename ~/Downloads/homework1_model.net`
If you downloaded the model file to somewhere other than ~/Downloads/, change the '-model_filename' flag to use that instead.
4) Examine the predictions.csv file that command generates, and see that it matches what we submitted on kaggle.
