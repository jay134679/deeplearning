Alex Pine (akp258)

1) My writeup can be found in the file 'akp258-hw4-writeup.pdf'
2) Download my model file from http://cims.nyu.edu/~akp258/model.hw4.net into the directory this README.txt file is in
3) To run the model, go to this directory in a shell, and run the following command:

th result.lua

NOTE: If you downloaded the model file to somewhere other than the current directory, use the '--model_file' flag to specify its location.
4) Examine the perplexity value it prints. It should match what I wrote in akp258-hw4-writeup.pdf.
