Deep Learning 2016: Homework 2
Maya Rotmensch (mer567) and Alex Pine (akp258)

1) Our writeup can be found at 'http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/pinesol/deeplearning/blob/master/hw2/HW2_answers.ipynb'
2) Download our model file from http://cims.nyu.edu/~akp258/model.net.2 into the directory this README-LeConv.txt file is in.
3) To run our model, you must be using a machine with a CUDA-enabled GPU. To generate out model's predictions, go to this directory in a shell, and run the following command:

th result.lua

NOTE: If you downloaded the model file to somewhere other than the current directory, use the '--model_filename' flag to specify its location.
4) Examine the predictions.csv file that command generates. It should match what we submitted on kaggle.
